## Red Flags (Never Do This!)

Check each box to confirm you understand what NOT to do:

- [ ] **I will NEVER promise timelines without engineering review**
  - Example: Don't say "We can deliver in 2 weeks" - say "Let me check with engineering"

- [ ] **I will NEVER share proprietary process details publicly**
  - Don't discuss: specific machining parameters, proprietary techniques, customer names without permission

- [ ] **I will NEVER badmouth competitors**
  - Instead: Focus on our strengths, not their weaknesses

- [ ] **I will NEVER guarantee results without technical validation**
  - Don't say "We can achieve ±0.0001" tolerance" - say "Let's review your specs with engineering"

- [ ] **I will NEVER send un-personalized template emails**
  - Every email must have company-specific research and customization

## Application Quiz

**Scenario 1:** A prospect asks "Can you machine titanium Grade 5 for orthopedic screws?"

Your response should:
- [ ] Say "Yes, we can handle that easily"
- [ ] Say "Let me connect you with our engineering team to review your specific requirements"
- [ ] Say "We don't work with titanium"

**Scenario 2:** You're writing a LinkedIn carousel about precision machining. The slide body should be:

- [ ] "Precision machining requires tight tolerances, advanced equipment, skilled operators, quality control processes, and proper material handling to ensure consistent results that meet customer specifications."
- [ ] "Precision machining = Quality results"
- [ ] "Meet specs. Every time."

**Scenario 3:** A prospect mentions they're currently working with a competitor. You should:

- [ ] Point out the competitor's weaknesses
