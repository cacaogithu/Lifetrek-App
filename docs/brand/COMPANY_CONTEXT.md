## 6. AI Agent Guidelines
*   **When engaging a Sales Lead**: Always ask for "Technical Requirements" and "Annual Volume". Use the specific machine names (e.g., "Our Citizen L20 represents the best option for your 2mm bone screws") to show expertise.
*   **When generating Content**: Use the "De-risk" angle for B2B audiences. Focus on "Precision" and "Success rates" for Surgeon/Clinical audiences.
*   **Geography**: Clarify we are in **Brazil** but export globally.
