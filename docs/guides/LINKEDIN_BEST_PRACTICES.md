## LinkedIn Algorithm & Philosophy

### Core Algorithm Signals
1. **Dwell Time**: How long users spend reading your post
2. **Engagement Rate**: Likes, comments, shares, saves
3. **Profile Views**: Content that drives profile visits
4. **Connection Quality**: Engagement from 1st vs 2nd/3rd degree connections
5. **Consistency**: Regular posting schedule (3-5x/week optimal)

### Content Hierarchy (Best Performing)
1. **Carousels** (documents) - Highest engagement
2. **Polls** - High engagement, lower quality leads
3. **Text + Image** - Solid performer
4. **Native Video** - Good reach if high quality
5. **Text Only** - Works if hook is strong
6. **External Links** - Lowest reach (algorithm penalty)

## Carousel Best Practices

### Technical Specifications
- **Dimensions**: 1080x1080px (square) or 1080x1350px (4:5 portrait)
- **Format**: PDF (converts to carousel), PNG/JPG sequence
- **Slides**: 5-10 optimal (7 is sweet spot)
- **File Size**: Under 100MB for PDFs
- **Text Size**: Minimum 30pt for readability on mobile

### Visual Design Rules
1. **Consistent Branding**: Same colors, fonts, visual style across slides
2. **High Contrast**: Dark text on light, or vice versa
3. **Minimal Text**: 20-40 words max per slide
4. **One Idea Per Slide**: Don't cram multiple concepts
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear headline > subhead > body
6. **Whitespace**: Let content breathe

### Slide Structure Template
```
Slide 1: HOOK
- Audience callout ("Orthopedic manufacturers:")
- Problem/curiosity statement
- Clear promise if they swipe

Slides 2-6: CONTENT
- One key insight per slide
- Numbered progression (1 of 5, etc.)
- Specific examples, not vague claims
- Mix of text and visual elements

Slide 7: CTA
- Single action to take
- Low friction (comment word, DM, link in bio)
- Clear benefit statement
```

## Hook Formulas That Work

### The Callout Hook
"[Audience]: If you're still [doing X], you're losing [specific loss]."

**Example**: "Dental implant manufacturers: If you're still accepting 0.5% defect rates, you're leaving $50K/year on the table."

### The Counter-Intuitive Hook
"I stopped [common practice] and [unexpected result]."

**Example**: "We stopped qualifying leads by company size. Our close rate went up 40%."

### The Risk/Loss Hook
"[X] is costing [audience] [specific amount] every [timeframe]."

**Example**: "Supplier quality issues cost medical device companies $2.3M per recall."

### The Social Proof Hook
"[Number] [audience members] already [benefit]. Here's how:"

**Example**: "127 orthopedic OEMs reduced their supplier audits by 60%. Here's the framework:"

### The Curiosity Gap Hook
"The [thing] that [big result] (and why most [audience] miss it)."

**Example**: "The inspection process that catches 99.7% of defects (and why most CNC shops skip it)."

## B2B Medical Device Content Angles

### Pain Points to Address
1. **Regulatory Risk**: FDA 483s, warning letters, MDR compliance
2. **Quality Issues**: Non-conformities, recalls, CAPAs
3. **Supplier Risk**: Qualification costs, audit fatigue, single-source dependencies
4. **Time-to-Market**: Delays in prototyping, validation, production ramp
5. **Cost Pressure**: Manufacturing costs, scrap rates, rework
6. **Technical Challenges**: Tight tolerances, material selection, DFM issues

### Content Themes for Lifetrek
1. **Quality Leadership**: ISO 13485, 100% inspection, traceability
2. **Technical Expertise**: Swiss turning, 5-axis, CMM capabilities
3. **Risk Reduction**: How we prevent defects, recalls, compliance issues
4. **Partnership Approach**: Long-term collaboration vs transactional
5. **Brazil Manufacturing**: Cost advantages, ANVISA compliance, local support
6. **Industry Insights**: Trends in medical device manufacturing

### Proof Points to Include
- 30+ years experience
- ISO 13485 certified
- ANVISA approved
- Citizen CNC equipment (Swiss machines)
- CMM inspection (ZEISS or equivalent)
- ISO 7 cleanroom packaging
- <0.1% defect rate target
- 0.5-32mm Swiss turning capability

## Caption Writing Guidelines

### Structure
```
[Hook - same as slide 1]

[2-3 sentences expanding on the promise]

[Tease specific content: "In this carousel, I share:"]
• Point 1
• Point 2
• Point 3

[Bridge to CTA]

[CTA - clear action]

[Hashtags - 3-5 relevant ones]
```

### Caption Length
- **Optimal**: 150-200 words
- **Maximum**: 300 words before "see more" cuts off
- **First Line**: Must hook within 125 characters (preview cutoff)

### Hashtag Strategy
**For Medical Manufacturing:**
- #MedicalDeviceManufacturing
- #PrecisionMachining
- #ISO13485
- #MedTech
- #OrthoImplants
- #DentalImplants
- #CNCMachining
- #QualityControl
- #RegulatoryAffairs
- #MedicalDevices

**Rules:**
- 3-5 hashtags maximum
- Mix of broad (#MedTech) and specific (#ISO13485)
- Place at end of caption
- No hashtag stuffing

## CTA Best Practices

### Low-Friction CTAs
1. **Comment Trigger**: "Comment [WORD] and I'll send the checklist"
2. **DM Request**: "DM 'ORTHO' for the full guide"
3. **Save Prompt**: "Save this for your next supplier audit"
4. **Poll CTA**: "Vote below: Which matters more?"

### Medium-Friction CTAs
1. **Link in Bio**: "Full case study in link in bio"
2. **Tag Someone**: "Tag a quality manager who needs this"
3. **Follow CTA**: "Follow for more manufacturing insights"

### High-Friction CTAs (Use Sparingly)
1. **Book a Call**: "Schedule a discovery call [link]"
2. **Website Visit**: "See our capabilities at [site]"
3. **Download Gated Content**: "Get the free checklist at [link]"

### CTA Rules
- One CTA per carousel
- Match CTA to content value delivered
- More value given = higher friction CTA acceptable
- Always state what they get and why it matters

## Posting Strategy

### Optimal Times (Brazil/Americas)
- **Best**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am local time
- **Good**: Monday/Friday, 8-10am or 12-1pm
- **Avoid**: Weekends, after 6pm

### Frequency
- **Minimum**: 2-3 posts/week
- **Optimal**: 5 posts/week
- **Maximum**: 1-2 posts/day (avoid burnout, maintain quality)

### Content Mix
- 50% Educational (carousels, how-tos)
- 25% Authority (case studies, results)
- 15% Engagement (polls, questions)
- 10% Promotional (offers, CTAs)

## Engagement Tactics

### First 60 Minutes
Critical window for algorithm. Take these actions:
1. Reply to every comment within 1 hour
2. Ask follow-up questions in replies
3. Share to relevant LinkedIn groups
4. Engage with other posts (10-15 min before/after posting)

### Comment Boosting
- Reply length matters: 10+ word replies signal quality
- Ask questions in replies to continue conversation
- Tag relevant people when appropriate
- Use emojis sparingly (1-2 per reply max)

---

## Content Recycling

### Reusable Formats
1. **Framework Posts**: "5 steps to X" can be reused quarterly
2. **Mistake Lists**: "7 supplier mistakes" updated annually
3. **Before/After**: Different examples, same structure
4. **Myth-Busting**: Industry myths never go stale

### Repurposing Strategy
- Carousel → Individual text posts (1 slide = 1 post)
- Carousel → Thread/article expansion
- Popular post → Updated version in 3-6 months
- Engagement data → Inform future topics

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Selling Too Early**: Lead with value, not pitch
2. **Being Generic**: Specific > general always
3. **Ignoring Comments**: Engagement signals matter
4. **Inconsistent Branding**: Visual chaos reduces trust
5. **Wall of Text**: Break up content, use white space
6. **Hashtag Overload**: 3-5 max, not 20
7. **External Links in Post**: Put in comments or bio instead
8. **No Clear CTA**: Every post should have one action
9. **Posting and Leaving**: First hour engagement is critical
10. **Copying Competitors**: Authenticity wins long-term
