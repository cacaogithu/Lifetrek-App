# Sales Engineer 30-60-90 Day Plan

> **Philosophy:** "I'm not hiring you to do work. I'm hiring you to solve problems. Here are your problems to solve in 30, 60, and 90 days." - Alex Hormozi

This plan outlines the **problems you need to solve** - not tasks to complete. Your job is to figure out HOW to solve them creatively and efficiently.
