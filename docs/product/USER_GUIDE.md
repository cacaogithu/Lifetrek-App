## 👷‍♂️ Sales Engineer Guide

Your command center is the **Dashboard EV**. Here is how to master it.

### 1. analyzing a Lead
Don't just read—**analyze**. The dashboard gives you superpowers:
-   **⭐ AI Score (1-5)**: Trust this. A '5' means they match our ideal customer profile (Medical OEM + High Volume).
-   **🚨 Priority Badges**:
    -   <span style="color:red">**High (Red)**</span>: Drop everything. This lead is hot.
    -   <span style="color:orange">**Medium (Yellow)**</span>: Follow up within 4 hours.
    -   <span style="color:green">**Low (Green)**</span>: Nurture track.

### 2. Utilizing the Sales Agent (AI) 🤖
Stop staring at a blank screen. The **"Assistente IA"** tab is your pair programmer for sales.

> [!TIP]
> **Prompt like a Pro**: Be specific about the output you want.

| Goal | Try saying this... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Drafting an Email** | *"Draft a reply to Dr. Silva regarding the Titanium Screw RFQ. Emphasize our ISO 13485 certification and 5-axis capabilities in Portuguese."* |
| **Technical Check** | *"What are the max dimensions for our Citizen Swiss-type lathe?"* |
| **Objecion Handling** | *"The client says our lead time is too long. Give me 3 bullet points on why our quality assurance process is worth the wait."* |
