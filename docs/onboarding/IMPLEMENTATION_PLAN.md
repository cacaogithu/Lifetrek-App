## FAQ for New Hire

**Q: I don't have a technical background. Will I be able to answer technical questions?**  
A: You don't need to answer everything. Your job is to *qualify* and *escalate* to the technical team when needed. Use the scripts provided, and when in doubt, say: "Great question. Let me connect you with our engineer who can give you the exact specs."

**Q: What if I send a message and no one responds?**  
A: Normal! B2B response rates are 10-20%. Focus on volume + quality. Use the follow-up sequences, and don't take silence personally.

**Q: How do I know if a lead is good or bad?**  
A: Use the scoring matrix (Section 3.2 of Operational Playbook). When in doubt, score conservatively and flag for mentor review.

**Q: What if someone asks for a discount on my first week?**  
A: Never promise a discount alone. Say: "Let me check with my team what we can do. Can you help me understand what budget you're working with?"
