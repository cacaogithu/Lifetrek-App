Ahh got it — you’re asking about **MCP with Make**. Straight talk 👇

---

## What **MCP** means (in this context)

**MCP = Model Context Protocol**

It’s a **standard way for AI models (LLMs)** to:

* Discover tools
* Call actions
* Read/write data
  **without custom glue code every time**

Think of MCP as:

> *“OpenAPI, but for AI agents.”*

---

## Does **Make.com** support MCP **natively**?

**No — not yet.**
As of now, **Make** does **not** expose a native MCP server.

But 👀 **you can absolutely integrate Make INTO an MCP setup.**

---

## The practical architecture (what actually works)

### ✅ **Recommended setup**

```
LLM (ChatGPT / Claude / Agent)
        ↓  MCP
MCP Server (your backend)
        ↓  HTTP / Webhooks
Make.com Scenarios
        ↓
Apps, APIs, DBs, CRMs
```

---

## How to connect **Make.com ↔ MCP**

### Option 1 — **Make as a Tool via Webhooks (most common)**

1. Create a **Custom Webhook** in Make
2. Your **MCP server** exposes a tool like:

   * `create_lead`
   * `send_whatsapp`
   * `update_crm`
3. MCP tool → calls Make webhook
4. Make handles logic + integrations

👉 This is how most production AI agents do it today.

---

### Option 2 — **MCP Server wraps Make APIs**

If you want more control:

* MCP server calls **Make API**
* Triggers / manages scenarios programmatically
* Less visual, more infra-heavy

Only worth it if you’re scaling hard.

---

## Example: MCP Tool → Make Webhook

**MCP tool definition (conceptual):**

```json
{
  "name": "create_whatsapp_lead",
  "description": "Create a new WhatsApp lead in CRM",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "name": { "type": "string" },
      "phone": { "type": "string" }
    },
    "required": ["name", "phone"]
  }
}
```

**Tool execution →**

```
POST https://hook.make.com/xxxxx
{
  "name": "João",
  "phone": "+551199999999"
}
```

---

## When Make + MCP is a GREAT combo

Perfect if you want:

* 🧠 LLM reasoning
* ⚙️ Visual automations
* 🔌 3rd-party integrations fast
* 🚀 No custom infra for every API

This is **exactly** the pattern you’re already close to with:

* AI agents
* n8n / Make
* CRM + WhatsApp + scheduling

---

## When NOT to use Make

Avoid if:

* You need **low latency**
* You’re doing **10k+ actions/min**
* You need **transaction guarantees**
  → then go pure backend + queues.

---

## TL;DR

* ❌ Make doesn’t support MCP natively
* ✅ Make works **perfectly as an MCP tool backend**
* ✅ MCP = brain, Make = hands
* ✅ Best setup: **MCP server → Make Webhooks**

If you want, I can:

* Design an **MCP server spec** for your agents
* Show **Make scenario patterns** for AI tools
* Compare **Make vs n8n vs pure MCP**

Just say the word.
