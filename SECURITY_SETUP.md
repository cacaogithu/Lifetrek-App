# Security Setup Guide

## ✅ COMPLETED PHASES

### Phase 1: Security & Critical Fixes ✅
### Phase 2: Legal Compliance & Monitoring ✅

---

## Phase 1 Implementation Status ✅

### ✅ Database Security - COMPLETED
All RLS policies have been strengthened and secured:

#### Analytics Events Table
- **Fixed**: Removed potential data exposure in insert policy
- **Status**: Only authenticated admins can view analytics data
- **Impact**: Company emails and sensitive analytics data now protected

#### Admin Users Table  
- **Fixed**: Strengthened admin management policies
- **Status**: Only admins can manage admin users, users can view own status
- **Impact**: Prevents privilege escalation attacks

#### Product Catalog Table
- **Fixed**: Optimized RLS policies with explicit permissions
- **Status**: Public read access, admin-only write access
- **Impact**: Secure product management

#### Performance Optimizations
- Added indexes on frequently queried columns for better performance
- Indexes on: analytics events (created_at, event_type), product_catalog (category), user_roles (user_id)

### ✅ Edge Functions - COMPLETED

#### Rate Limiting Implemented
All public-facing edge functions now have rate limiting:

1. **send-contact-email**: 5 requests/minute per IP
2. **send-calculator-report**: 3 requests/minute per IP  
3. **chat**: 10 requests/minute per IP

Rate limiting prevents abuse and DDoS attacks by tracking requests per IP address.

#### Removed Unused Function
- **analyze-product-image** removed from config (was configured but not implemented)

### ⚠️ Auth Configuration - ACTION REQUIRED

**Leaked Password Protection**: Currently DISABLED

**To Enable:**
1. Go to your backend dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > Settings
3. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
4. This will prevent users from using commonly leaked passwords

### ✅ Error Tracking - COMPLETED

**Sentry Integration Implemented:**
- ✅ @sentry/react installed and configured
- ✅ Automatic error capture in production
- ✅ Session replay on errors
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Centralized error logging via errorLogger.ts

**Next Steps:**
1. Create Sentry account at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. Create new React project in Sentry
3. Add `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable to deployment
4. See MONITORING_SETUP.md for detailed instructions

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- ✅ Zod schemas for form validation (Contact, Assessment pages)
- ✅ Client-side and server-side validation

### 2. Rate Limiting
- ✅ IP-based rate limiting on all public edge functions
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of rate limit data
- ✅ Configurable limits per endpoint

### 3. Database Security
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ✅ Proper role-based access control
- ✅ Security definer functions to prevent recursive RLS issues
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure in policies

### 4. Authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control using separate user_roles table
- ✅ Server-side role verification
- ✅ No client-side role storage
- ⚠️ Need to enable leaked password protection (see above)

### 5. Error Handling
- ✅ ErrorBoundary components
- ✅ Centralized error logging
- ✅ No sensitive data in error messages
- 🔧 Production error tracking ready to implement

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

- [ ] All RLS policies tested with different user roles
- [ ] Rate limiting working correctly (test with multiple requests)
- [ ] Admin authentication flow secure (no client-side role checks)
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully
- [ ] No console.log statements expose sensitive data
- [ ] Leaked password protection enabled
- [ ] Production error tracking configured (if using Sentry/LogRocket)
